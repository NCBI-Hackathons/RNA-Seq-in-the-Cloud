General Workflow:

Main Idea: Detection of Novel Transcripts in RNA Seq Data

Programming Language: Python

1. Input: .gtf annotation file

2. Filtering on .gtf to remove implausable transcripts (tx)
  i. (NL's portion)
    a. remove all tx with less than 1 intron (intronless tx) *
    b. remove external exons (remove tx with exons which overlap with introns that do not belong to a known promotor region)
    c. remove txs with retained introns
  
 ii. * Novel Tx with TSS suport (Maggie)
 iii. * Intron Structure in AlignDB (IJ)
 
 3. Output tsv file with four columns (All)
    Chromosome, Start of Exon coordinates, Stop of Exon coordinates, Strand (anti or not)
